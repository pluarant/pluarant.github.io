On-Premise vs Cloud offering, Which one is better?: |

  You can't go wrong with either model. Although our cloud services let you start immediately, there are several reasons why you need On-Premise, and one of the key reasons is to have ultimate control over your data. More than ever before, it has become imperative to protect your data and be more sensitive towards your user data, be it personal data, financial data, medical records, GDPR, HIPPA, unauthorized harvesting of your data, companies selling, misusing your data for advertisement, to name a few. 
  
   Mesibo On-premise offering puts you in complete control of your data since everything runs on your own servers.If you do not wish to host Mesibo on your own server infrastructure, you have the option of using the Cloud offering by Mesibo. Also, even when running On-Premise, you can always use Mesibo cloud as a back-up, which gives you best of the both worlds.

Can we run it along with our Web server or Do we need additional hardware?: |

  Indeed, you can run Mesibo On-Premise along with your existing web server without investing in additional hardware. Unlike other solutions that require heavy runtime like Java, Mesibo is entirely written in C++ which makes it a very lightweight (similar to other industry-standard software like Nginx, etc.), and it can easily co-exist with your web-server.

Do we need to pay extra?: |

  Absolutely not! You don't have to pay anything extra to use Mesibo On-Premise solution, our pricing for on-premise and cloud solution is the same.

What is Auto fallback to cloud option ?: |

  In the configuration console for On-Premise if you enable auto fall back to cloud, Mesibo will automatically connect to cloud service ,if your dataceneter is having an issue. Note that, some of the offline messages will not be delivered in fallback mode since Mesibo cloud has no access to your database.

What is do not perform network check option ?: |
