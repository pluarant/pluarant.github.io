Do I have to pay for it?: |

  The best part is that Mesibo is free! Allow us to repeat, it’s completely free!! You only need mesibo paid services if your app outnumbers mesibo free tier limit. View our <a href="/pricing.html#payg" target="_blank">pay as you go</a> pricing.


I'm developing my app and will eventually need to upgrade. Can I do this when I launch and expand?: |

  Yes, of course. The free tier is the ideal testing ground for when you're developing your app. As long as your requests do not exceed the limitations and you're happy to just use it.


Is there any limitation on the number of applications, users, or groups? What happens if I exceed the limitations?: |

  There are no limitations. However, mesibo has intelligent algorithms to detect unfair usage and abuse patterns and in such conditions, requests from your users may be throttled.

What is 'Monthly Active Users'?: |
  Monthly Active Users (MAU) is a key performance indicator (KPI) often used by mobile apps, online games and social networking sites. MAU represents the unique monthly active users for a monthly billing period. MAU is counted when an user connects to mesibo server within a monthly billing period. To further clarify, it will be only counted as one when a unique user connects to mesibo server multiple times during the monthly billing period. A connection is required to perform any types of communication (sending and receiving messages, calls etc) between users and servers.

What is Concurrent Users (peak connections/simultaneous connection)?: |
  `Concurrent Users` is a metric of the maximum users connected to mesibo server at the same time in any given moment. This number does not quantify unique users at all and is a raw count of connections. Typically, CCU is 10% of daily active users (DAU) which is typically 50% of MAU. However, these metrics vary from an app to app and also depending on the nature of the app. Calculating and watching CCU will help you determine the right mesibo plan for your app today and in the future.

  Concurrent users are also referred to as peak or simultaneous connections.

What is Message Rate Limit?: |
  Message rate limit (throttling) is referred to as a total number of messages that can be sent by all your users in any given second. Typically, a message rate/second for an application like WhatsApp is 0.05% of MAU (based on public stats). mesibo assigned much higher rate limit than that so you should encounter rate limit only in rare circumstances.

Does the limit applies to Voice and Video calls?: |
  Typically 5 to 8 messages are exchanged to set up or re-connect a voice or video call. In addition to that, minimal messages are exchanged from each end every few seconds to keep call alive, exchange quality and control information etc. All these messages are subject to total messages limit and rate limits.

Do Voice and Video call quality differs in FREE and PAYG Plan?: |
  Absolutely not - quality remains the same whether you are in free or a premium plan.

  However, you can add your own TURN servers in PAYG plans. TURN servers add reliability to calls by assisting some users that are behind badly behaving or symmetric firewalls (roughly 5% of users).

Are there any features difference between the PAYG and FREE plan?: |
  No, all the features are available in all the plans. The only difference is the capacity.

What happens if my apps exceed the limits of FREE plan or credits in PAYG plan?: |
  We usually do not throttle your app immediately, unless in extreme situations. We will send you an email and also inform your backend using webhook when your app usage exceeds 50% and 75% of the free limits in the free plan OR 50% and 75% of available credits in PAYG plan. We will throttle or temporarily disable your app only if you do not take any action after these notifications.

How do I know how much I am spending?: |
  The Mesibo console is the best way to keep a tab on your usage and charges.  The Mesibo console is updated every hour with the usage and corresponding charges.

Can I host mesibo on my own servers?: |

  Absolutely, it’s part of our in-premises offerings. Contact us at <a href="/contact.html" target="_blank">https://mesibo.com/contact.html</a> with your requirements.

Is there any agreement that we have to sign to use Mesibo?: |

  There is a Master service agreement / Terms available which is applicable to all the users. However, If your company is an enterprise-level customer, we do work with a customized agreement with custom SLAs. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:sales@mesibo.com">sales@mesibo.com</a> with your requirements.


How Monthly Active Users (MAU) calculated?: |

  MAU is counted when a user connects to Mesibo server within a monthly billing period. To further clarify, it will be only counted as one when a unique user connects to mesibo server multiple times during the monthly billing period. A connection is required to perform any types of communication (sending and receiving messages, calls etc) between users and servers.

How Concurrent users (peak connections/simultaneous connection) calculated?: |
  Concurrent User is counted as the maximum number of simultaneous connections to Mesibo servers by your users. If a user connects to Mesibo from two devices (connections), this counts as 2 concurrent users.
