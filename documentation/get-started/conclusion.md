## Congratulations!

You've a good overview of the Mesibo platform.

There is much more to the Mesibo platform than what was covered here, you now have a firm grasp
regarding the basics of real-time messaging, group messaging, voice and
video calls, UI modules etc.

Want to go deeper? How about writing a basic Mesibo app to send and receive real-time
messages?
