Where do Mesibo stores all the files?: |

  Mesibo does not store any files on Mesibo servers. Instead, Mesibo let you store all your files (images, videos, documents etc.) on your server(s). This allows you to control your files and protect your sensitive data. 

  You need to write a small upload and download handler which will be called whenever Mesibo needs to send or receive files. When mesibo need to send a file, your upload handler will be called with the file path using which you can upload the file and let mesibo know about the location where the file was uploaded. On the remote side, download handler will be called with that location so that the remote side can download the file. For more information, refer to the mesibo application source code on GitHub and also FileTransferHandler reference document.
  

Which protocol should I use to upload files?: |

  Mesibo does mandate protocol or how and where you store your files. You can use HTTPS or any property protocol. As long as you provide upload and download hander, Mesibo will work with any kind of protocols.

Can I store my files on public cloud platforms like Amazon S3, Google etc?: |
  Absolutely, there are two ways
  
  - once you upload files on your server, you can then upload them to one of the cloud providers of your choice and send the link back to your upload handler.   
  - Sign the request from the server and then directly send it. Refer to the documentation of your cloud provider. If you are using Amazon S3, refer [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingHTTPPOST.html)

Does Mesibo provides any APIs for uploading and download files?: |

  Yes, [Mesibo HTTP](/documentation/api/http-library/) is a very fast cross-platform library allows you to upload and download files to or from your server. Refer to the mesibo application source code on GitHub and Mesibo HTTP reference document.

  Android File Upload Example
