What is Mesibo?: |
  Most of the apps today require some form of real-time communication; say, if you are developing a dating app and you want your matches to communicate, OR creating a ridesharing app and you want your passengers to send cab request to a group of drivers in real-time, or a chatbot for flight booking or a messaging app like Whatsapp, whatever you do, real-time communication is pervading every part of our daily life and enabling new business models and revenue streams for the apps.
  
  Mesibo is a high performance, high-availability, asynchronous real-time messaging platform that allows your users (endpoints) to communicate with each other in real-time. With Mesibo, you can quickly add real-time messaging, voice and video calling (like WhatsApp) in your own app in no time.


Why Mesibo?: |
  Building your own real-time messaging or chat not only requires expertise, but it's a resource intensive and expensive task, both from development and testing perspective. It becomes more complex, especially when it involves connecting millions of users in real-time.
  
  Mesibo underpins the entire complexities of messaging, not only by providing client-side API &amp; UI, but a solid, scalable platform which is tested and adaptive to your needs. You can stay focused on your core app and leave the messaging complexities for Mesibo to handle.
