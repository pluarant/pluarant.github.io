What is group messaging?: |
  Group Messaging is the ability to send and receive Text, Picture, Video, location messages to multiple users in a group conversation. 

How I do I create a group and add members?: |

  You need to use <a href="/documentation/api/server-side-api/" target="_blank">Members server side API</a> to create a group and add members. 

  To create a group, use `groupadd` REST api. On successful creation, a group id will be returned. Once a group is created, you can add one or more of your users as group members by using ‘addmembers’ API. 

Who can send messages to a group?: |
  You can select who can send messages to a group by specifying a flag at the time of group creation (or later) by using `groupset` API. Mesibo offers you finer control over group and group members. For example, you can selectively decide which group member can send messages to the group. You can also configure group such that all the group members or anyone (group members or not) can send messages.

Who can receive messages from a group?: |
  Similar to send, you can select who all can receive messages from the group by specifying a flag at the time of group creation )or later) by using `groupset` API. You can specify particular group members (say admins), all group members or one of the member (round-robin) who can receive group messages.
  
  This approach of precisely controlling who can send or receive group messages gives you ultimate flexibility on how to define a group behavior, compared to some other API using hard-coded approach (for example, open or group channels).

How do I create an invite-only chat OR say, tinder like 1-on-1 messaging where two people can chat only if both of them want to stay connected?: |
  Very simple, create a group with only two members. They can chat as long as this group exists (till they want to stay connected). If one of the members decide to leave, just delete the group and they won’t be able to chat further.

How do I create a group of support staff such that only one of them receives  the message from the customer?: |
  That’s exactly round-robin flag is for. Create a group with round-robin flag and only one of the non-busy member will receive the message. You can make any member busy or free using the server-side API.

Is there any limit on the max numbers of groups?: |
