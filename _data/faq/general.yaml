What is Mesibo?: |

  Most of the apps today require some form of real-time communication; say, if you are developing a dating app and you want your matches to communicate, OR creating a ridesharing app and you want your passengers to send cab request to a group of drivers in real-time, or a chatbot for flight booking or a messaging app like Whatsapp, whatever you do, real-time communication is pervading every part of our daily life and enabling new business models and revenue streams .
  
  Mesibo is a high performance, high-availability, asynchronous real-time messaging platform that allows your users (endpoints) to communicate with each other in real-time. With Mesibo, you can quickly add real-time messaging, voice and video calling (like WhatsApp) in your own app in no time.

Why Mesibo?: |

  Building your own real-time messaging or chat not only requires expertise, but it's a resource intensive and expensive task, both from development and testing perspective. It becomes more complex, especially when it involves connecting millions of users in real-time.
  
  Mesibo underpins the entire complexity of messaging, not only by providing client-side API &amp; UI, but a solid, scalable platform which is tested and adaptive to your needs. You can stay focused on your core app and let Mesibo handle the complexities of messaging.

What are the key features offered by the Mesibo?: |

  Real-time Messaging - Mesibo offers a complete package of APIs for real-time communication. It not only includes the API, but also ready-to-use UI modules that you can customize to your needs. Some of the UI modules are - one-to-one messaging, group messaging, message list, contacts, group contacts, video calls, voice calls, media picker, media cropper, log-in, etc. 
  
  Video and Voice Calls - Mesibo offers a complete stack for voice communications. Along with the necessary codecs, Mesibo also offers components for high-quality calls like jitter buffer, packet loss concealment (PLC), acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), automatic gain control (AGC), noise reduction, etc.
  
  Media and TURN servers - Mesibo also offers media and TURN servers to handle your media traffic.

What platforms does Mesibo support?: |

  Mesibo API is available for all popular platforms - Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Web (Javascript) and Raspberry Pi. Mesibo APIs are designed such that all the mesibo API functions and data structures name the same across the platforms. You may also use mesibo API within hybrid development platforms like PhoneGap, Unity, etc.
  
  Mesibo also provides C/C++ API which allows you to integrate Mesibo with virtually any kind of software, for example, web backends, machine learning platforms, Matlab, etc.

How do I get a Mesibo account?: |
