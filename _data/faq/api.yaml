What is Message Expiry?: |

  The expiry represents the time within which a message has to be delivered. Expiry ranges from immediate (zero) to a few days and can be independently specified per-message basis at the time of sending messages. Mesibo will not deliver messages past its expiry. You can also set the expiry to zero for the messages that need to be delivered in real-time and not later. All messages will be retained by Mesibo until delivered or until their expiry is reached
  
  For example, to set an expiry of 7 days you need to specify it in seconds (7 days * 86400 sec/day)
  
  p.expiry = 604800
